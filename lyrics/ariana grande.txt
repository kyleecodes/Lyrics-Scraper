Thought I'd end up with Sean
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now I listen and laugh
Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to Malcolm
'Cause he was an angel
One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
So, look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say
Thank you, next 
Thank you, next 
Thank you, next
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
Thank you, next 
Thank you, next 
Thank you, next 
I'm so fuckin'—
Spend more time with my friends
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Plus, I met someone else
We havin' better discussions
I know they say I move on too fast
But this one gon' last
'Cause her name is Ari
And I'm so good with that 
She taught me love 
She taught me patience 
How she handles pain 
That shit's amazing 
I've loved and I've lost 
But that's not what I see 
'Cause look what I've found 
Ain't no need for searching, and for that, I say
Thank you, next 
Thank you, next

One day I'll walk down the aisle
Holding hands with my mama
I'll be thanking my dad
'Cause she grew from the drama
Only wanna do it once, real bad
Gon' make that shit last
God forbid something happens
Least this song is a smash 
I've got so much love 
Got so much patience 
And I've learned from the pain 
I turned out amazing 
Say I've loved and I've lost 
But that's not what I see 
'Cause look what I've found 
Ain't no need for searching
And for that, I say

Passionate, but I don't give no fucks
I admit that I'm a lil' messed up
But I can hide it when I'm all dressed up

Hey, ayy, oh yeah…Here's the thing: you’re in love with a version of a person that you've created in your head, that you are trying to but cannot fix. Uh, the only person you can fix is yourself. I love you, this has gone on way too long. Enough is enough. I'm two blocks away, I’m coming over.​
Painted a picture, I thought I knew you well
I got a habit of seeing what isn't there
Caught in the moment, tangled up in your sheets
When you broke my heart, I said you only wanted half of me
My imagination's too creative
They see demon, I see angel, angel , angel
Without the halo, wingless angel
Falling, falling, but I never thought you'd leave me
Falling, falling, needed something to believe in, oh
I thought you were the one
But it was all in my head
It was all in my head 
Yeah, look at you , boy, I invented you
Your Gucci tennis shoes, runnin' from your issues
Cardio good for the heart 
I figured we could work it out, hmm
Painted a picture; I thought I drew you well
I had a vision, seeing what isn't there
Caught in the moment, tangled up in your sheets
When you broke my heart, said you only wanted half of me
My imagination's too creative
They see Cain and I see Abel , Abel , Abel
I know you're able, willin’ and able
Falling, falling, but I thought that you would need me
Falling, falling, needed something to believe in, oh
I thought you were the one
But it was all in my head
It was all in my head 
Yeah, look at you , boy, I invented you
Your Gucci tennis shoes, runnin’ from your issues
Cardio good for the heart 
I figured we could work it out, hmm
Wanted you to grow, but, boy, you wasn't budding
Everything you are made you everything you aren’t
I saw your potential without seein' credentials
Maybe that's the issue 
Said maybe that's the issue, ah
Can’t hold that shit against you, ah
Guess I did it to myself, yeah
Thought you were somebody else, you
Thought you were somebody else, you 
Thought you were somebody else, youIt's like you got superpowers
Turn my minutes into hours
You got more than 20/20, babe
Made of glass, the way you see through me
You know me better than I do
Can't seem to keep nothing from you
How you touch my soul from the outside
Permeate my ego and my pride
I wanna love me 
The way that you love me 
Ooh, for all of my pretty and all of my ugly too
I'd love to see me from your point of view
I wanna trust me 
The way that you trust me 
Ooh, 'cause nobody ever loved me like you do
I'd love to see me from your point of view
I'm gеtting used to receiving
Still gеtting good at not leaving
I'ma love you even though I'm scared 
Learnin' to be grateful for myself 
You love my lips 'cause they say the
Things we've always been afraid of
I can feel it startin' to subside
Learnin' to believe in what is mine
I wanna love me 
The way that you love me 
Ooh, for all of my pretty and all of my ugly too
I'd love to see me from your point of view
I wanna trust me 
The way that you trust me 
Ooh, 'cause nobody ever loved me like you do
I'd love to see me from your point of view
I couldn't believe it or see it for myself
Know I be impatient
But now I'm out here, fallin', fallin'
Frozen, slowly thawing, got me right
I won't keep you waitin', waitin'
All my baggage fadin' safely 
And if my eyes deceive me
Won't let them stray too far away
I wanna love me 
The way that you love me 
Ooh, for all of my pretty and all of my ugly too
I'd love to see me from your point of view
I wanna trust me, ooh 
The way that you trust me, baby 
'Cause nobody ever loved me like you do
I'd love to see me from your point of view

So I don't lose my mind, baby, yeah
I can feel it on my skin 
Teardrops on my face 
Let it wash away my sins 
Let it wash away, yeah
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain

One giant leap for woman-kind
I'd rather be alone tonight
You can say "I love you" through the phone tonight
Really don’t wanna be in your arms tonight
I'll just use my covers to stay warm tonight
Think I'm better off here all alone tonight
Ain’t no checkin' on when I get home tonight
Just makin' sure I'm good on my own tonight
Even though there isn't nothin' wrong tonight
Yeah, I'm just sayin', baby
I can’t really miss you if I’m with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial
It’s like I'm the universe and you be N-A-S-A
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I’ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space 
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space 
Bottom line
Usually, I would love it if you stayed the night
I just think I'm on another page tonight
It ain't nothing wrong with saying I need me time
Usually, I would orbit around you
But gravity seems to be the only thing that's pulling me
You'll be my rise and shine soon as them stars align, mmm
Baby, I can't really miss you if I'm with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial
It's like I'm the universe and you be N-A-S-A
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space

I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space

You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover
Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under
You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover
Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under

Boy, you're such a dream to me
"Excuse me, um, I love you"
I know that's not the way to start a conversation, trouble
I watch them other girls when they come and bug you
But I felt like I knew you, so I just wanted to hug you
Plus you don't know your way around
You can stop your playing now
All your worries, lay 'em down, shh, don't say it loud
Is this real, baby?
You're like: "I love you—who starts a conversation like that?" Nobody, but I do
But you are not a picture, I can't cut you up and hide you
I'll get you out my mind, mhm, or try to
But I just want to stand and yell
I will never dare to tell
Think I heard some wedding bells, shh, keep it to yourself
Is this real? 
Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Don't wanna wake up, oh no
Wake up, wake up, wake up
'Cause you're such a dream

Before your boy gets smart, I would never try to
You know I'm thinking to myself, "What happened? Why you?"
But when I see you in my dreams, psh, I know
You know how to treat it, you know how to eat it
You know how to beat it

Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout
Nothing to prove and I'm bulletproof and
Know what I'm doing
The way we're movin'
Like introducing us to a new thing
I wanna savor, save it for later
The taste, the flavor, 'cause I'm a taker, 'cause I'm a giver
It's only nature, I live for danger

You know that I'm playin', so don't be mistaken
You already know what I'm thinkin', boy

Just say goodnight and go
Ohh, ohh, ohh

One of these days
You'll miss your train and come stay with me
We'll have drinks and talk about things
And any excuse to stay awake with you
And you'd sleep here, I'd sleep there
But then the heating may be down again
We'd be good, we'd be great together
Why'd you have to be so cute?
It's impossible to ignore you, woah
Why must you make me laugh so much?
It's bad enough we get along so well
Just say goodnight and go

They keep telling me to let go
But I don't really let go when I say so 
I keep giving people blank stares 
I'm so different when you're not there 
It's like something out of Shakespeare
Because I'm really not here when you're not there
I've tried to fight our energy
But every time I think I'm free 
You get high and call on the regular
I get weak and fall like a teenager
Why, oh why does God keep bringing me back to you?
I get drunk, pretend that I'm over it
Self-destruct, show up like an idiot
Why, oh why does God keep bringing me back to you?
I go back to you, back to you, back to you
Back to you, back to you, back to you
I go back to you, back to you, back to you every time
Just when I get on a new wave 
Boy, you look at me and I slip outta my lace
They keep calling me a head-case
'Cause I can't make a good case why we can't change
I've tried to fight our energy 
But every time I think I'm free 
You get high and call on the regular
I get weak and fall like a teenager
Why, oh why does God keep bringing me  back to you?
I get drunk, pretend that I'm over it
Self-destruct, show up like an idiot
Why, oh why does God keep bringing me back to you?
I go back to you, back to you, back to you 
Back to you, back to you, back to you 
I go back to you, back to you, back to you every time 
I go back to you, back to you, back to you 
Back to you, back to you, back to you
I go back to you, back to you, back to you every timeUh-huh! It's Iggy Iggs!
I got one more problem with you girl, hey!
Hey baby, even though I hate ya, I wanna love ya
And even though I can't forgive ya, I really want to
Tell me, tell me, baby, why can't you leave me?
'Cause even though I shouldn't want it, I gotta have it
Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser, and realize that I've got
One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem
One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem
I know you're never gonna wake up, I gotta give up
I know I shouldn't ever call back or let you come back
Every time you touch me and say you love me
I get a little bit breathless, I shouldn't want it
Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser, and realize that I've got
One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem
One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya 
I got one less problem without ya 
I got one less, one less problem
It's Iggy Iggs!
Uh, what you got?
Smart money bettin' I'll be better off without you
In no time I'll be forgettin' all about you
You sayin' that you know, but I really, really doubt you
Understand my life is easy when I ain't around you
Iggy Iggy, too biggie to be here stressin'
I'm thinkin' I love the thought of you more than I love your presence
And the best thing now is probably for you to exit
I let you go, let you back, I finally learned my lesson
No half-steppin', either you want it or you just playin'
I'm listenin' to you knowin' I can't believe what you sayin'
There's a million you's baby boo, so don't be dumb
I got 99 problems but you won't be one, like what
Mmm, nah, one less, one less problem
Mmm, yeah, one less, one less problem
Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser, and realize that I've got
One less problem without ya 
I got one less problem without ya 
I got one less problem without ya 
I got one less, one less problem 
One less problem without ya 
I got one less problem without ya

If you just let me invade your space
I’ll take the pleasure, take it with the pain
And if in the moment, I bite my lip
Baby, in that moment, you’ll know this is
Something bigger than us and beyond bliss
Give me a reason to believe it
'Cause if you want to keep me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Got to love me harder
And if you really need me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Got to love me harder 
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Love me, love me, love me
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Harder, harder, harder
I know your motives and you know mine
The ones that love me, I tend to leave behind
If you know about me and choose to stay
Then take this pleasure and take it with the pain
And if in the moment you bite your lip
When I get you moaning, you know it's real
Can you feel the pressure between your hips?
I’ll make it feel like the first time
'Cause if you want to keep me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Got to love me harder 
And if you really need me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta

Stay right where you are, 'cause
I never knew, I never knew
You could hold moonlight in your hands
'Til the night I held you

Sweet like candy, but he's such a man
He knows just what it does when he’s holding me tight
And he calls me "moonlight" tooWhen raindrops fell down from the sky
The day you left me, an angel cried
Oh, she cried

When finding love is a battle
But daylight is so close
So don't you worry 'bout a thing
We're gonna be alright 
We're gonna be alright 
We're gonna be alright
Baby, don't you know?
All of them tears gon' come and go
Baby, you just gotta make up your mind
That every little thing is gonna be alright
Baby, don't you know?
All of them tears gon' come and go
Baby, you just gotta make up your mind
We decide it
We're gonna be alright 
We're gonna be alright 
We're gonna be alright
In slow motion
Can't seem to get where we're going
But the hard times are golden
'Cause they all lead to better days
We're gonna be alright 
We're gonna be alright 
We're gonna be alright
Baby, don't you know?
All of them tears gon' come and go
Baby, you just gotta make up your mind
That every little thing is gonna be alright 
Baby, don't you know?
All of them tears gon' come and go
Baby, you just gotta make up your mind
We decide it
We're gonna be alright 
We're gonna be alright 
We're gonna be alright
We're gonna be alright, ayI'd like to say we gave it a try
I'd like to blame it all on life
Maybe we just weren't right
But that's a lie, that's a lie
And we can deny it as much as we want
But in time our feelings will show
'Cause sooner or later we'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is, everyone knows
Almost, almost is never enough
So close to being in love
If I would have known that you wanted me the way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each other's arms
And we almost, we almost knew what love was
But almost is never enough
If I could change the world overnight
There'd be no such thing as goodbye
You'd be standing right where you were
And we'd get the chance we deserve, oh
Try to deny it as much as you want
But in time our feelings will show
'Cause sooner or later we'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is everyone knows
Almost, almost is never enough
So close to being in love
If I would have known that you wanted me the way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each other's arms
And we almost, we almost knew what love was
But almost is never enough
Huh-huh, baby
You know, you know, baby
Almost, is never enough, baby
You know, hey
And we can deny it as much as we want
But in time our feelings will show
'Cause sooner or later we'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is, everyone knows
Almost, almost is never enough 
So close to being in love 
If I would have known that you wanted me
The way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each other's arms
And we almost, we almost knew what love was 
But almost is never enough
Huh-huh, baby 
You know, you know, baby
Almost, is never enough, baby
You know, heyWill I ever love the same way again? 
Will I ever love somebody like the way I did you?
Never thought you'd be so damn hard to replace
I swear it don't need to be this way
If I can't have you, is love completely off the table?
Do I sit this one out and wait for the next life? 
Am I too cold? Am I not nice?
Might not be quite yet healed already
Should I be goin' too steady? 
But I just wanna know is love completеly off the table?
Will you be thеre? 
Can I still love you? 
Not yet healed or ready 
Should I be goin' too steady? 
Just wanna know is love completely off the table?
I'll wait for you
Even though it always feels like I'll be number two
To someone you can't hold anymore
If you let me in, I'm ready to give you what I couldn't before
'Cause I got you, girl, let me help you through it
You're trying to fill the void with a couple boys
I can see right through it 
I can love you harder than I did before
Was in a dark place back then
I was toxic, then I was toxic to someone else
I was haunted by the hills 
I couldn't give you my all, but I will
If you let me in your arms 
If you let me in your heart
I don't think that love's completely off the table
Will you be there? 
Can I still love you? 
Not yet healed or ready 
Should I be goin' too steady? 
Just wanna know is love completely off the table?
So can you hold me?
If I let you, can you prove it to me? 
'Cause I need you to calm me down, babe
Gotta get out of my head 
Tryna be here from this bed 
Just wanna know, just wanna know, know, know, baby 
Can you touch it like you believe in it, baby? 
Let me think you never gonna leave on me, baby
'Cause I ain't her and you ain't him, thankfully 
But it's gon' be hard to let someone else in again 
Baby, baby 
Will you be there? 
Can I still love you? 
Not yet healed or ready 
Should I be goin' too steady? 
Just wanna know is love completely off the table, baby?
I swear, I swear
I will wait for you whenever you need
Ooh, oohOh, yeah
Wake up in my bed, I just wanna have a good day 
Think it in my head, then it happens how it should, ayy
Twelve o'clock, I got a team meeting, then a meditation at like 1:30
Then I ride to the studio listening to some shit I wrote 
Good karma, my aesthetic 
Keep my conscience clear, that's why I'm so magnetic
Manifest it , I finessed it 
Take my pen and write some love letters to Heaven
Just like magic , just like magic 
Middle finger to my thumb and then I snap it
Just like magic , I'm attractive 
I get everything I want 'cause I attract it 
Looking at my phone, but I'm tryna disconnect it 
Read a fuckin' book, I be tryna stay connected 
Say it's tricky at the top, gotta keep a slim ego for a thick wallet
Losing friends left and right, but I just send 'em love and light 
Good karma, my aesthetic 
Keep my conscience clear, that's why I'm so magnetic
Manifest it , I finessed it 
Take my pen and write some love letters to Heaven
Just like magic, just like magic
Middle finger to my thumb and then I snap it 
Just like magic, I'm attractive
I get everything I want 'cause I attract it
I don't wanna waste your time on some dumb shit
Password to your phone, you can miss me with that shit
Redesign your brain, we gon' make some new habits
Just like magic , just like magic
Just like magic , just like magic 
Middle finger to my thumb and then I snap it
Just like magic , I'm attractive 
I get everything I want 'cause I attract it 
Mmm, mmm 
Mmm-oh, yeah
Mmm, yeah, mmmHow soon do we forget how we felt
Dealing with emotions that never left
Playing with the hand that we were dealt in this game
Maybe I'm the sinner and you're the saint
Gotta stop pretending what we ain't
Why we pointing fingers anyway when we're the same?
Break up, make up
Total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds and stop acting like we’re blind? 
'Cause if the water dries up and the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind
Boy, you know I'll be savin' my love for you, for you
]
'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made
But we hold on, mm, hold on
There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase
But we hold on , mm, hold on, eh 
I guess time's wasting
Tick-tocking, lip locking
How can we keep the feelings fresh?
How do we zip lock it?
Wear your heart up on your sleeve
So watch out for pickpockets
I guess to go the distance we might need to pit stop it
Hold up, I know love can be a beach with no shore
I done count to ten, lost my temper and went back to four
I know sometimes it's hard to realize I'm the man that you need
I had a dream we branched out, started a family tree, huh
And I feel like that everything we do is overdue
You asked why I love your mom so much, 'cause she's a older you
I wish that you were happy
I guess that's the one thing I should be providing
Ain't no number twos
We both ones of ones, and we the oddest couple
Only humans, 'cept you, you a goddess
Only lying to you when I lie you down, just being honest
When you start as friends, it's hard to say you're never going back
If I'm not the one, then I'm the best mistake you ever had
Break up, make up
Total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds and stop acting like we’re blind?
'Cause if the water dries up and the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind
Boy, you know I'll be savin' my love for you, for you
'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made
But we hold on, mm, hold on
There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase
But we hold on, mm, hold on, eh
You, you, you, you
I'll be savin' my love for you, for you
You, you, you, you
I'll be savin' my love for you, for youThis bitch gon' make me...
You got me all up in my feels, in all kind of ways
I be tryna wait, but, lately, I just wanna keep it real 
No more playin' safe, let's take it all the way

Promise I'm still gonna love you when you wake up in the AM
I just wanna make time for ya
Swear it's just right for ya
Like this pussy designed for ya
Ten outta five on ya
Know I would sign on the line for ya
Bet I look nice on you 
Open my mind for ya

Don't wanna wait on it
Tonight, I wanna get nasty 
Tonight, I wanna get nasty 
Boy, you know the vibes, I don't waste no time
Take what's on your mind, make it real life
Get all the homies to bounce
Switch from the bed to the couch
And get to know how I'm feelin' inside
So much conversation, words so sweet
Been so well-behaved, but, boy, I'm weak
Yeah, my body's gotta say something to you
That's one way to tell I speak the truth
Don't wanna wait on it 
Tonight, I wanna get nasty 
What you waitin' for? 
What you waitin' for? 
Don't wanna wait on it
Tonight, I wanna get nasty
What you waitin' for? 
What you waitin' for? 
Don't wanna wait on it
Tonight, I wanna get nasty 
Tonight, I wanna get nasty 
YeahMu-Mu-Mu-Murda
Tell me why I get this feeling
That you really wanna turn me on
Tell me why I get this feeling
That you really wanna make me yours, ah
'Cause I see you tryin', subliminally tryin'
To see if I'm gon' be the one that's in your arms
I admit it's exciting, parts of me kinda like it
But before I lead you on
Baby, tell me, what's your motive? 
What's your motive?
What's your motive? 
So tell me, what's your motive? 
What's your motive?
What's your motive? 
I could call bullshit out from a mile away 
You want me if you can keep comin' back for me
Might have to curve you if you just can't talk straight 
Say what you mean 'cause you might get it
'Cause I see you tryin', subliminally tryin'
To see if I'm gon' be the one that's in your arms
I admit it's exciting, parts of me kinda like it
But before I lead you on
Tell me, what's your motive?
What's your motive?
What's your motive? 
So tell me, what's your motive?
What's your motive?
What's your motive? 
You treat me like gold, baby
Now you wanna spoil me
Did you want a trophy or you wanna sport me, baby?
Want me on your neck 'cause you wanted respect
'Cause you fightin' some war, baby
Well, I had to bring the fists out, had to put a wall up
But don't trust phonies, baby 
You gotta tell me, what's your motive, baby?
'Cause you got your candy  on your arm 
No need to sugarcoat a lie 
Say what you want, I needed a real bonafide G 
Can you promise me you'll bring it all tonight? 
'Cause I need you to be wise
Tell me everything that's on your mind, come on
Baby, tell me what's your motive? 
What's your motive? 
What's your motive? 
So tell me, what's your motive? 
What's your motive? 
What's your motive? If you want it, take it
I should've said it before
Tried to hide it, fake it
I can't pretend anymore
I only wanna die alive
Never by the hands of a broken heart
I don't wanna hear you lie tonight
Now that I've become who I really am
This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more
This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more
You were better, deeper
I was under your spell, yeah
Like a deadly fever, yeah, babe
On the highway to hell, yeah
I only wanna die alive
Never by the hands of a broken heart
I don't wanna hear you lie tonight
Now that I've become who I really am
This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more
This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more
No more, baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Thought of your body, I came alive
It was lethal, it was fatal
In my dreams, it felt so right
But I woke up every time
Ooh, baby
This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before 
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more
This is  the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no moreTale as old as time
True as it can be
Barely even friends
Then somebody bends
Unexpectedly
Just a little change
Small to say the least
Both a little scared
Neither one prepared
Beauty and the Beast
Ever just the same
Ever a surprise
Ever as before
And ever just as sure
As the sun will rise
Oh-oh
Hey
Yeah, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Oh-oh, ever just the same, oh
And ever a surprise, yeah
Ever as before
And ever just as sure
As the sun will rise
Oh, oh, oh
Tale as old as time, a-a-ay
Tune as old as song, oh
Bitter-sweet and strange
Finding you can change
Learning you were wrong, woah
Certain as the sun
Certain as the sun
Rising in the east
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the Beast
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the Beast
Woah 
Beauty and... 
Beauty and the BeastMy presence sweet and my aura bright
Diamonds good for my appetite
Guess it fuckin' just clicked one night
All them demons helped me see shit differently
So don't be sad for me
How you been spending your time? 
How you be using your tongue? 
You be so worried 'bout mine 
Can't even get yourself none
You know you sound so dumb 
You know you sound so dumb 
So maybe you should shut up, mmm
Yeah, maybe you should shut up
Said if only you would shut up 
Yeah, that's right, you should shut up 
I vibrate high and my circle lit
We ain't really with drugs and shit
Love the game so I ain't nevеr miss
Keep opinions muted for the hell of it
'Causе I like my shit 
How you been spending your time? 
How you be using your tongue? 
You be so worried 'bout mine 
Can't even get yourself none
You know you sound so dumb 
You know you sound so dumb 
So maybe you should shut up, mmm
Yeah, maybe you should shut up
Said if only you would shut up 
Yeah, that's right, you should shut up I cried enough tears to see my own reflection in them
And then it was clear
I can't deny I really miss it
To think that I was wrong
I guess you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
Pain is just a consequence of love
I'm saying sorry for the sake of us
He wasn't my everything 'til we were nothing
And it's taking me a lot to say
Now that he's gone, my heart is missing something
So it's time I push my pride away
'Cause you are, you are
You are my everything
You are, you are
You are my everything
I know you're not far, but I still can't handle all the distance
You're traveling with my heart
I hope this is a temporary feeling
'Cause it's too much to bear without you
And I know "sorry" ain't the cure
If I cross your mind, just know I'm yours
'Cause what we got is worth fighting for
'Cause you are
You weren't my everything 'til we were nothing
And it's taking me a lot to say
Now that you're gone, my heart is missing something
So it's time I push my pride away
You are, you are
You are my everything
You are, you are
You are my everything
Ooh, hmm, ha, yeah
You are, you are, you are, ooh
You are, you are, you are
My everythingLet's go!
Baby, I just want you to be mine
Won’t you give me a bit of your time? Oh, whoa
Chasin' you, no, I won't stop tryin’
Just meet me at the borderline 
You play hard-to-get
But I know you want me, too
Ain't out here looking for other dudes
So I'ma keep it tight for you
You know I'm the wifey type, babe
You know I be one of a kind, oh whoa
Once you tastin' my ice cream, I bet you won't ever leave

Stop playing, too hard for me
Baby, I just want you to be mine
Won’t you give me a bit o’ your time? Oh, whoa
Chasin' you, no, I won’t stop tryin'

You know I'm the wifey type, babe
You know I be one of a kind, oh whoa 
Once you tastin' my ice cream, I bet you won't ever leave

Quit playin' too hard for me
Stop playing, too hard for me
Baby, I just want you to be mine
Won't you give me a bit of your time? Oh, whoa
Chasin' you, no, I won't stop tryin'
Just meet me at the borderline
Uh, I'm like, you got me so on a chase
Got me feeling so out of place
Think 'bout you all of my days
Wish you'd chew on me like fresh grapes
Not tryna cuff you or crowd your space
I'm tryna find cute words just to say
"Dang, you fine, and look at that face"
At the borderline, beside me, you lay
Baby, I just want you to be mine
Won't you give me a bit of your time? Oh, whoa
Chasin' you, no, I won't stop tryin'
Just meet me at the borderlineHow do I make the phone ring?
Why do I even care?
How are you all around me, when you're not really there? 
When you're not really there? 
How do I feel you on me, when you're not on my skin?
Why do you say you want me, then tell me you're not coming in?
Ah, yeah, baby, just come on in 
'Cause every time I'm with you, I go into a zone
And I remember all the places you wanna go
Take me all the way 
Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it

I'm tired of being patient, so let's pick up the pace
Take me all the way 
Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it
How do you know I'm breathing, when I'm holding my breath?
Why don't we face the danger, just for the night and forget? 
Baby, let's just forget 
Remind me why we're taking a break
It's obviously insane
'Cause we both know what we want
So why don't we fall in love?
Baby, let's fall in love, oh-oh

But don't you be scared
To run your hands through my hair
Baby, 'cause that's why it's there
Come run your hands through my hair
Ooh, baby, so don't you be scared
So come run your hands through my hair
It's been way long overdue
Just like these inches down my back
Usually don't let people touch it
But tonight, you get a pass
Spend my dimes and spend my time
To keep it real, sometimes it's tracks
But I don't care, mmm
So run your hands through my hair
Baby, 'cause that's why it's there
Come run your hands through my hair

Ooh, don't you be scared
Come run your hands through my hair
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-ohThere is somethin' between us, I can see it right now
Your magnetic demeanor, that’s something can't be found
I thought that I was dreamin' ’til my love came around
Now I just come on over, show you how we get down
Shawty, you can get blazed
I can't believe that you are here, I can't believe it's happening
What are the odds that you'd appear?
The universe so vast to me
Seven billion is on the Earth
Could've been anywhere, but you're here with me
Should I play Lotto? What's it worth?
I must be on, so clear to me
Once I have you, I will never let you, never let you
Once I have you, I will never let you, never let you go
Never let you, never let you go
Never let you, never let you go
Never let you, never let you go
Never let you
There is somethin’ between us, I can see it right now
Your magnetic demeanor, that’s something can't be found
I thought that I was dreamin’ 'til my love came around
Now I just come on over, show you how we get down
Shawty, you can get blazed
Look at you, love, you are the same
You have a light you cannot hide
Yes, you may have a different face
But your soul is the same inside
I don't care who is listening
'Cause they be making fun of this on TV
They wouldn’t laugh if they were inside my past life
With you and they were me
Once I have you, I will never let you, never let you
Once I have you, I will never let you, never let you go
Never let you, never let you go
Never let you, never let you go, oh
Never let you, never let you go, yeah
Never let you
Don't think that it cannot happen, 'cause it can
Shawty, you can get blazed
Sleep if you want, and wake up in love again
Shawty, you can get blazed
Once I have you, I will never let you, never let you
Once I have you, I will never let you, never let you go
Never let you, never let you go
Never let you, never let you go
Never let you, never let you go
Never let youI love the taste of you in the morning
Keep me warm and
Nothin' else, nothin' more important
Makes me wanna believe in love 
I love the thought of us in the evening
Crave the feeling
The way you feel, somethin' 'bout it's healing
I'm praying we don't fuck this up 
Others that I've had had to impress me before
But I knew you were the real thing
When you walked through the door
I didn't think that I would have to spell it out
Don't put the bands, put the bands on me
Oh, my love, oh, my love is free
Ain't no price on my loyalty
No shit, got me right where you want me, baby
Could I be more obvious? 
Hard to think when I'm under you
Tell you all of my dirty truths
No shit, got me right where you want me, baby
Could I be more obvious?
Maybe if I'm lucky, you might stay the afternoon
If you gotta work, just promise me you'll come back soon
Maybe you should pack a suitcase too 
I love the thought of you never leavin' 
Days repeatin'
Gettin' steps up on the treadmill while you sleepin'
Never thought I'd believe in love again
Others that I've had had to impress me before 
But I knew you were the real thing
When you walked through the door
I didn't think that I would have to spell it out
Don't put the bands, put the bands on me
Oh, my love, oh, my love is free
Ain't no price on my loyalty
No shit, got me right where you want me, baby
Could I be more obvious? 
Hard to think when I'm under you
Tell you all of my dirty truths
No shit, got me right where you want me, baby
Could I be more obvious? Ooh-ooh, hey
Put your hands up 
So put your hands up  
You got it, you got it, babe 
You got it, you got it, babe 
You got it, you got it, babe 
You got it, you got it, babe
Okay, this, this, this one for my number one girl who got the top spot title
Spent a hour in the bathroom, walked out looking like a model
God, doing what you do, got me right there with Apollo on the moon
Who needs genies in a bottle, girl, if they already got you? 
Boy, you make me feel so lucky
Finally the stars align
Never has it been so easy to be in love
And to give you this heart of mine
You know what I need 
I know what you like 
Put it all together, baby, we could be alright 
How could this be wrong when it feels so right?
Yeah, I really love you
I really love you, oh
And I'll never let you go
You should know I'm never gonna change
I'm always gonna stay
You call for me, I'm right there 
Right there 
'Cause you listen and you care
You're so different
No one compares
And if you never change, I'm gonna stay right there
I'll always be right there
You got it, you got it, babe 
You got it, you got it, babe, yeah 
And I get butterflies just thinking
About you, boy, you're on my mind 
Sometimes I catch myself daydreaming
Lost in your eyes and I lose all track of time 
You know what I need 
I know what you like 
Put it all together, baby, we could be alright 
How can this be wrong when it feels so right?
Yeah, I really need you
I really love you, oh
And I'll never let you go
You should know I'm never gonna change
I'm always gonna stay
You call for me, I'm right there 
Right there 
'Cause you listen and you care
You're so different
No one compares
And if you never change, I'm gonna stay right there 
I'll always be right there 
Now, if all fell through, would you catch me before the pavement? 
If my Benz turned back to public transportation 
Would you still be at home for me with the candles waiting 
And get my mind back adjacent to the place of a young visionary?
A player too, you know I have some girls missionary 
My black book and numbers thicker than the dictionary and Bible
I got it recycled
I love and I like you
Five course meals, even though you don't mind a drive-thru
That's why I got you
And I'll never let you go 
You should know  I'm never gonna change 
I'm always gonna stay  
You call for me, I'm right there 
Right there 
'Cause you listen and you care
You're so different
No one compares
And if you never change, I'm gonna stay right there 
I'll always be right there 
You got it  
I'll always be right there   
 
I'll always be right there
You got it, you got it, babe  
You got it, you got it, babe 
You got it, you got it, babe 
You got it, you got it, babe 
Got it, babeOoh, I know you're probably thinkin' what's the use
I promise it's the little things that you do
That make me wanna give it all to you
You know I do, baby
You soothe me
You hold it down with every word you speak, oh babe
Baby
Been a minute since I had something so sweet
If you're gonna keep speaking my love language
You can talk your shit all night
You the medication when I'm feeling anxious
That's the kind of shit I like
Teach me how to love you
I'm unlearning what ain't right
I want you to keep speaking my love language
Baby, talk your shit all night
Why would I double back or do the same thing twice?
A question, something that I can't deny
Leavе my baggage at the door, I'll claim you mine
All minе
You soothe me
You hold it down with every word you speak, oh babe
Baby
It's been a minute since I had something so sweet
Mmm, oh hey

You can talk your shit all night
You the medication when I'm feeling anxious
That's the kind of shit I like
Teach me how to love you
I'm unlearning what ain't right
I want you to keep speaking my love language
Baby, talk your shit all night
Baby, pardon my French, but could you speak in tongues?
Never lost in translation 'cause you know what I want, boy
Treat it just like Givenchy , it's expensive to taste
Ain't no need to remind ya, it's AG in your face
If you're gonna keep speaking my love language
You can talk your shit all night
You the medication when I'm feeling anxious
That's the kind of shit I like
Teach me how to love you
I'm unlearning what ain't right
I want you to keep speaking my love language
Baby, talk your shit all night
Head over my shoes like woah

Running 'cause you're just my speed

Your ex-girlfriend don't want no smoke 
I ain't tryna sign no lease
I'm just gon' make you my homeAh, hey, yeah
I know I be on some bullshit
Know I be driving you crazy
But I know you love how I whip it
You can only stay mad for a minute
So come here and give me some kisses
You know I'm very delicious
You know I'm very impatient
Might change my mind, so don't keep me waiting
I just wonder, baby, if you're gonna stay
Even if, one day, I lose it and go crazy
I know this shit kinda heavy
I just wanna tell you directly
So, boy, let me know if you ready
Are you down? What's up?
Are you down? What's up?

You know you be on some bullshit 
Act so possessive and crazy 
But I know that's just 'causе you love me
And you ain't scared to show mе your ugly

And you wonder, baby, if I'm gonna stay

Baby, 'cause you know I'm coming back
You're making me forget my past
Never thought I’d feel like that again
I came to peace with my path
Now you got me off track
I've never been this scared before
Feelings I just can't ignore
Don't know if I should fight or fly
But I don't mind
Mmm
Tripping, falling, with no safety net
Boy, it must be something that you said
Is it real this time or is it in my head?
Got me tripping, falling, with no safety net
Let your guard down, girl
You know we came too far now, girl 
It's timе for you to play your part now
You know we hit that jewelry storе and we gon' ball out
Ups and downs, we had some fallouts 
Put some ice on you, girl, let it thaw out 
Girl, you're mine, it's safe to say
At the end of the day
I've never been this scared before
Feelings I just can't ignore
Don't know if I should fight or fly
But I don't mind  
Mmm 
Tripping, falling, with no safety net
Boy, it must be something that you said 
Is it real this time or is it in my head?

Got me tripping, falling, with no safety net 
Oh hey

Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I don't ever ask you where you've been
And I don't feel the need to know who you're with
I can't even think straight
But I can tell that you were just with her
And I'll still be a fool
I'm a fool for you
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I don't ever tell you how I really feel
'Cause I can't find the words to say what I mean
And nothing's ever easy, that's what they say

But I'll still be a fool
'Cause I'm a fool for you
Just a little bit of your heart

'Cause I'm here all alone
I know I can't wait 'til you get home
Oh, I don't have you here with me
But at least I have the memory
I try to make it through the night
But I can't control my mind
I'm just thinkin' 'bout you
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you
I'm just thinkin' 'bout you
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you
Got these thoughts in my head

Nobody got me the way that you did
Had my eyes rolling back
Had me arching my back
Now you love me so good
I wish you would hurry up and come back
Oh, I don't have you here with me

I'm just thinkin' 'bout you 
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you 
I'm just thinkin' 'bout you
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you 
Baby, I don't want no one, no one else
So hurry, 'cause I need some, need some, need some help
And I've been waiting patient, patiently
'Cause I don't have you here with, here with, here with me
But at least I have the memory
I'm just thinkin' 'bout you 
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you 
I'm just thinkin' 'bout you
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you

Still so into us
I never thought I'd be here
Should've turned to dust
Ooh, let's be honest, baby
This is so unusual
Ooh, I'm not tempted, baby
Even if they're beautiful
I used to be cautious
A little too reckless
Now all my emotions
Are all 'cause of you
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
I ain't even think of letting go
I ain't ever thought of going nowhere
I don't even see it down the road
'Cause we're collectin' moments
Tattoos on my mind
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
I ain't even think of letting go
Not even sometimes

It used to be easy
For someone to steal me
Now all my emotions
Are all 'cause of you, boy
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
I ain't even think of letting go
I ain't ever thought of going nowhere
I don't even see it down the road

Tattoos on my mind
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
I ain't even think of letting go
Not even sometimes, babe
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Why it never worked, but it's going to now
You don't know, you don't know, you don't know
What it does to me when I feel you around
Is it love? Is it lust? Is it fear?
But it's hard to breathe when you're touching me there
Hard to breathe when you're kissing me there
Hard to breathe when you're not here
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
I ain't even think of letting go
I ain't ever thought of going nowhere
I don't even see it down the road
'Cause we're collectin' moments

And nothing frightens me, baby, more
Is it love when so easily you said goodbye?
Is it love when we've given up before we tried? Mmm
Is it love when you stole my peace of mind?
Is it love when you cry, and cry and cry?
So when you walk out that door
Don't you come back no more
My heart has had enough of the give and take
And as much as I want you to stay
You're a dangerous love 
Maybe you're no good for me, darling 
Cause if you're gonna love me and leave me hanging here
Then I'd rather you leave me lonely 
Even though it hurts
Ooh, you're a dangerous love, oh, hey

Uh, I'm ready to make that turn
Before we both crash and burn
'Cause that could be the death of us, the death of us
Baby, you know how to drive in rain
And you decided not to make a change
Stuck in the same old lane
Goin' the wrong way home
I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic

Let's just go back to the way it was

Honeymoon Avenue, baby
Coastin' like crazy

Hey, what happened to the butterflies?
Guess they encountered that stop sign
And my heart is at a yellow light, a yellow light
Hey, right when I think that we've found it 
Well, that's when we start turnin' around 
You're sayin' "Baby, don't worry"
But we're still goin' the wrong way
Baby, you know how to drive in rain
And you decided not to make a change
Stuck in the same old lane
Goin' the wrong way home
I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic
I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you the way that I want
Let's just go back to the way it was
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue, baby
Coastin' like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was?
They say only fools fall in love
Well, they must've been talkin' about us
And sometimes I feel like I've been here before
I could be wrong, but I know I'm right
We're gon' be lost if we continue to fight
Honey, I know that we can find our way home
I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic
I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you the way that I want
Let's just go back to the way it was

When we were on
Let's just go back, b-b-b-back, back, backUsed to cry 'bout some crazy shit before

But if I can't be me, the fuck's the point?
No…

Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year
Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
"Let It Snow" is blasting out
But I won't get it in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year
I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day, I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

This year I've got to be smart

My baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things, hey
Just imagine that we're laughing
In the cabin, chilling by the fireside
Even though this sun is blasting
We can be wherever if we visualize
Hey, yo
I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole
Turning the heat into an ice cold holiday
Made just for me and my baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
My baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things, heyWhat do you mean? Oh, oh
When you nod your head yes, but you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey, yeah
When you don't want me to move, but you tell me to go
What do you mean? Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're running out of time, what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind, what do you mean?
You’re so indecisive of what I'm sayin'
Tryna catch the beat, make up your heart
Don't know if you're happy or complainin'
Don't want for us to end, where do I start?
First you wanna go to the left, then you wanna turn right 
Wanna argue all day, makin' love all night 
First you're up, then you’re down, and then between 
Oh, I really wanna know
What do you mean? Oh, oh
When you nod your head yes, but you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey, yeah
When you don't want me to move, but you tell me to go
What do you mean? Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're runnin' outta time, what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind, what do you mean?
You’re overprotective when I’m leaving
Tryna compromise, but I can’t win
You wanna make a point, but you keep preachin'
Had me from the start, don't let this end
First you wanna go to the left, then you wanna turn right
Wanna argue all day, makin' love all night 
First you're up, then you’re down, and then between 
Oh, I really wanna know
What do you mean? Oh, oh
When you nod your head yes, but you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey-ey
When you don't want me to move, but you tell me to go
What do you mean? 
Oh, what do you mean? 
Said you're running out of time, what do you mean? 
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind, what do you mean?
Oh, oh 
When you nod your head yes, but you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey, yeah 
When you don't want me to move , but you tell me to go
What do you mean? 
Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're running outta time, what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind, what do you mean?Center of attention once again
They don't understand
They don't understand, no
Then they try to tell me who I am
They don't understand
They don't understand, no
You want a perfect picture to believe in?
Then you can't be looking for me then
I don't need to live by your rules 
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes 
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life, so truth be told
I see you thinking but there's just one thing, dear
You think you know, but you don't have no idea
Think you know me, but there's more to see, my love
The same arguments time and time again
And you watch them all happen
But they don't understand, no
Thinking you're the reason that it ends
And he won't be back again
But they don't understand, no
You want a perfect picture to believe in?
Then you can't be looking for me then
I don't need to live by your rules 
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes 
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life, so truth be told
You don't know me
The girl you see in photographs is only a part of the one I am
Don't judge me
'Cause that's not reality
And all I can be is in love with who I'm becoming
Think you know me, but there's more to see, my love
You think you know, but you don't have no idea
I don't need to live by your rules 
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes 
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life, so truth be told
I see you thinking, you don't know me
I don't need to live by your rules 
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes 
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life, so truth be told
I see you thinking, but there is just one thing, dear
You think you know, but you don't have no idea
Think you know me, but there's more to see, my love
My loveOh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Here we go
I could write a song with my new piano
I could sing about how love is a losing battle
Not hard 
It's not hard 
It's not hard 
It's not hard 
And I could sing about Cupid and his shooting arrow
In the end, you'd find out that my heart was battered
Real hard 
It's so hard 
Real hard 
It's that hard 
But I'd rather make a song they can play on the radio
That makes you wanna dance
Don't it make you wanna dance?
But I'd rather make a song they can play on the radio
That makes you wanna grab your lover's hand
So hold up and take it through the night
And you should follow through to make it alright
Now grab each others' hands, get ‘em up
I wanna see you rock to the piano, the piano, oh
I could write a song by my new piano
I could sing about how love is a losing battle
Not hard 
It's not hard 
It's not hard 
It's not hard 
And I could sing about Cupid and his shooting arrow
In the end, you'll find out that my heart was battered
Real hard 
So hard 
Real hard 
It's that hard 
But I'd rather make a song they can play on the radio
That makes you wanna dance
Don't it make you wanna dance?
But I'd rather make a song they can play on the radio
That makes you wanna grab your lover's hand
So hold up and take it through the night
And you should follow through to make it alright
Now grab each others' hands, get ‘em up
I wanna see you rock to the piano, the piano
So hold up and take it through the night
And you should follow through to make it alright
Now grab each others' hands, get ‘em up
I wanna see you rock to the piano, the piano
I'd rather tell you about how I'm feeling, boy
And how I'm doing things my way
If I got my piano, then I'm gon' be okay, baby
So hold up and take it through the night
And you should follow through to make it alright
Now grab each others' hands, get ‘em up
I want to see you rock to the piano, the piano
So hold up and take it through the night
And you should follow through to make it alright
Now grab each others' hands, get ‘em up
I want to see you rock to the piano, the piano
So hold up and take it through the night
And you should follow through to make it alright
Now grab each others' hands, get ‘em up
I want to see you rock to the piano, the piano
I could write a song by my new piano
I could sing about how love is a losing battle
It's not hard 
It's not hard 
It's not hard
